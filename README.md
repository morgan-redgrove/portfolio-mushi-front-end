# portfolio-mushi-front-end

Mushi is a mobile app designed to help people find and identify wild mushrooms. This was completed as a final project during the Northcoders Full-stack development boot camp.

Mushi was created using React Native and Expo, It makes use of an API created during the same project (https://github.com/FisherTom/portfolio-mushi-api).

App users can report sightings of mushrooms and provide a location, picture, a description and the species they believe the mushroom to be.
Users are then able to browse reports from other users via the map screen, here users can filter results by species.
Viewing a report users can vote for a species they believe the mushroom to be, the back-end will set the species assigned to the report to the species with the highest votes automatically.
The back-end also calculates a species credibility score based on the number of votes for the assigned species and the number of conflicting votes.
The app makes use of Firebase for secure user authorization and blob storage.

## cloning this repo

use

```
npm install
```

to install packages, you will need to create a firebaseConfig.js file in the root directory as per firebase docks. This will need to export auth and storage config objects.
