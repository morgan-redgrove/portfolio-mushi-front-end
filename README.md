# portfolio-mushi-front-end

Mushi is a mobile app designed to help people find and identify wild mushrooms. This was completed as a final project during the Northcoders Fullstack development bootcamp.

Mushi was created using React Native and Expo, It makes use of an API created during the same project (https://github.com/FisherTom/portfolio-mushi-api).

App users can report sightings of mushrooms and provide a location, picture, a description and the species they belive the mushroom to be.
Users are then able to browse reports from other users via the map screen, here users can filter results by species.
Viewing a report users can vote for a species they belive the mushroom to be, the backend will set the species assigned to the report to the species with the highest votes automatically.
The backend also calcultes a species credibility score based on the number of votes for the assigned species and the number of conflicting votes.
The app makes use of Firebase for secure user authorization and blob storage.
